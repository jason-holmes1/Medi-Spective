# Phase-5-Project
# A mental Health API, that helps users take hold of their mental health in a quick and compact way, with a community built to help destigmatize talking about our issues 

# Here's a brief overview of the application:

# User Authentication: Users can register and log in to their accounts. This can be handled by Flask using libraries like Flask-Login or Flask-Security.

# Mood Tracking: Users can input their mood daily on a scale. This data can be stored in a database managed by Flask-SQLAlchemy.

# Journaling Feature: Users can write about their day, thoughts, and feelings. This can also be stored in the database.

# Mood Analysis: Analyze the mood data over time to identify patterns or triggers. This can be done using Python's data analysis libraries like pandas and numpy.

# Resource Recommendations: Based on the user's mood patterns, the app can suggest resources like articles, videos, or mental health professionals. This can be done using a simple recommendation algorithm.

# Community Support: A forum where users can share their experiences and support each other. This can be managed by Flask.

# Reminder System: Reminders for users to input their mood or use mindfulness techniques. This can be done using Flask-APScheduler.

# React Frontend: The frontend of the application can be built with React. It can display the user's mood data in graphs using libraries like Chart.js, provide forms for journal entries, and display the community forum.

# Remember to ensure user data is securely handled and privacy is respected, as this application deals with sensitive information.
